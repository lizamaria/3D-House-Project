# 3D-House-Project

The results we're interested in are DSM (Digital Surface Map) and DTM (Digital Terrain Map).
Which are already computed and available here :
- [DSM](http://www.geopunt.be/download?container=dhm-vlaanderen-ii-dsm-raster-1m&title=Digitaal%20Hoogtemodel%20Vlaanderen%20II,%20DSM,%20raster,%201m)
- [DTM](http://www.geopunt.be/download?container=dhm-vlaanderen-ii-dtm-raster-1m&title=Digitaal%20Hoogtemodel%20Vlaanderen%20II,%20DTM,%20raster,%201m)

##How: the how so far...
Deployment strategy :
	 Github page
	| Powerpoint
	| Jupyter Notebook
	| Webpage
	| App
  
 ##What 
 ## The Mission
 > you make a little program that accepts a **coordinate** and shows a nice **3D plot** of the **house** at the location.
 
 ### Must-have features :
- 3D lookup of houses.

 ### Nice-to-have features
- Optimize your solution to have the result as fast as possible.
- Features like the living area of the house in m², how many estimated floors, if there is a pool, the vegetation in the neighborhood, etc... 
- Better visualization.

##Why

##When
- Duration: `2 weeks`
- Deadline: `20/11/20 9:00 AM`
